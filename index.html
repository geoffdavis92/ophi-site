    <p>Omega Phi is a men's social club at Harding University. We strive to emulate Christ
      in all that we do, whether it's in the classroom, on the athletic field,
      or around campus. The club conducts its recruitment process during the Fall
      semester of the academic year, featuring open house meetings and themed mixers;
      this process then culminates in Club Week. During this time, potential members
      will get to know the current members of the club, and will get an overall vision
      of what Omega Phi is all about. </p>
    <p>Apart from functions and fellowshipping with one another, club members participate
      in interclub athletics, devotional groups, functions, and retreats. There are
      plenty of activities that members can go to and socialize with fellow members.</p>
